\title{
Simulates canopy assimilation for C3 canopies
}
\description{
  It represents an integration of the photosynthesis function
  \code{\link{c3photo}}, canopy evapo/transpiration and the
  multilayer canopy model \code{\link{sunML}}.
}
\usage{
c3CanA(lai, doy, hr, solar, temp, rh, windspeed, lat = 40, nlayers = 8, kd = 0.1, heightFactor = 3, c3photoControl = list(), lnControl = list())
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{

\item{lai}{leaf area index.}
\item{doy}{day of the year, (1--365).}
\item{hr}{hour of the day, (0--23).}
\item{solar}{solar radiation  (\eqn{\mu}{micro} mol \eqn{m^{-2}}{m-2} \eqn{s^{-1}}{s-1}).}
\item{temp}{temperature (Celsius).}
\item{rh}{relative humidity (0--1).}
\item{windspeed}{wind speed (m \eqn{s^{-1}}{s-1}).}
\item{lat}{latitude.}
\item{nlayers}{number of layers in the simulation of the canopy (max
  allowed is 50).}
\item{kd}{ Ligth extinction coefficient for diffuse light.}
\item{heightFactor}{ Height Factor. Divide LAI by this number to get the
  height of a crop.}
\item{c3photoControl}{
list that sets the photosynthesis parameters for c3 plants through the
c3photoParms function
}
\item{lnControl}{ list that sets the leaf nitrogen parameters.

  LeafN: Initial value of leaf nitrogen (g m-2).
  
  kpLN: coefficient of decrease in leaf nitrogen during the
  growing season. The equation is LN = iLeafN * exp(-kLN * TTc).

  lnFun: controls whether there is a decline in leaf nitrogen with the
  depth of the canopy. 'none' means no decline, 'linear' means a linear
  decline controlled by the following two parameters.

  lnb0: Intercept of the linear decline of leaf nitrogen in the depth of
  the canopy.

  lnb1: Slope of the linear decline of leaf nitrogen in the depth of
  the canopy. The equation is 'vmax = leafN_lay * lnb1 + lnb0'.

\details{
  The photosynthesis function is modeled after the version in WIMOVAC.
  This is based on the well known Farquar model.
