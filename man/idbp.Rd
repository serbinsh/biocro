\title{Initial Dry Biomass Partitioning Coefficients}
\usage{
  idbp(data, phenoControl = list())
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{Should have at least five columns with:
  ThermalT, Stem, Leaf, Root, Rhizome and Grain.}

  \item{phenoControl}{list that supplies mainly in this
  case the thrmal time periods that delimit the
  phenological stages,}
}
\value{
  It returns a vector of length 25 suitable for
  \code{BioGro}, \code{OpBioGro}, \code{constrOpBioGro}, or
  \code{MCMCBioGro}.
}
\description{
  Atempts to guess good initial vales for dry biomass
  coefficients that can be passed to \code{BioGro},
  \code{OpBioGro}, \code{constrOpBioGro}, or
  \code{MCMCBioGro}.  It is very fragile.
}
\details{
  This function will not accept missing values. It can be
  quite fragile and it is rather inflexible in what it
  expects in terms of data.
}
\note{
  It is highly recommended that the results of this
  function are tested with \code{\link{valid_dbp}}.
