\title{Miscanthus assimilation field data}
\description{
  assimilation as measured in Beale, Bint and Long (1996) in Miscanthus.
 The first column is the observed net assimilation rate
(\eqn{\mu} mol \eqn{m^{-2}} \eqn{s^{-1}}).
 The second
column is the observed quantum flux  (\eqn{\mu} mol \eqn{m^{-2}} \eqn{s^{-1}}). The third column is the
temperature (Celsius).Relative humidity was not reported and thus was assumed to
be 0.7.
