\title{Biomass crops growth simulation}

\description{
  Simulates dry biomass growth during an entire growing
  season.  It represents an integration of the photosynthesis function
  \code{\link{c4photo}}, canopy evapo/transpiration \code{\link{CanA}},
  the multilayer canopy model \code{\link{sunML}} and a dry biomass
  partitioning calendar and senescence. It also considers, carbon and
  nitrogen cycles and water and nitrogen limitations.
